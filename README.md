# Benjamin-Graham-Quant
An attempt to quantify the Benjamin Graham Criteria for defensive investors, 
to look over a big number of companies and see fast which satisfy the criteria.

Hi, glad to see you want to test some business using Bnejamin Graham criteria.

Open the Business_info_file_v0.txt and change the instructions for the data or " 1 " or " 0 " (without brackets).

Remember that the answer you have to put depends on the data asked, sometimes is not a number, just an answer like
I have comented above. The data you will have to put is:

Number of bussiness analyzed (Number)
Name of the Business (Name)
Market Value (Number)
Total assets (Number)
Liabilities (Number)
Has been getting earnings during the last 10 years in a row? (1 (1 if it is true) or 0 (if it is false))
Has been paying dividends during the last 20 years in a row? (1 (1 if it is true) or 0 (if it is false))
Current earnings per share (Number)
Earnings per share ten years ago (Number)
Price of the share (Number)
Book value per share (Number)

Between Businesses you have to keep a blank space!!

Remember also to put the total number of business you want to analyze.

After that save the changes and execute the program, you will get a text file with the results of the tests.

Those tests are the following:

Size test: evaluates the size of the company (has to be more than 2 USD billions)
 Strong financial condition test: the assets have to be at least two times the total liabilities
 Earnings past ten years test: the business has to get positive earnings during the las 10 years in a row
 Dividend record test: the business has to paid dividends the last 20 years in a row
 Earnings growth test: the earnings per share have to grow at least a 30% over the past 10 years
 P E test: the P/E ratio has to be less than 15 (Price/Earnings)
 Price to Book test: the price to book value has to be less than 1.5 times the Price
 Buy_test: if all the conditions are satisfied means that the business is a safe investment

You will find an example as a example.txt

Always clean all the files (the result file, before doing executing the code)

Have fun and don't gamble!!
